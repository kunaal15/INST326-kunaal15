This week I used AI to help me draft a discussion post for my class about AI tools and their limitations. I compared responses from two different AI platforms, Gemini and Claude, to see how context affects accuracy. I also used AI to help me draft a reply to a classmate. I learned that AI responses are much better when the AI has context or prior information. I also realized it is important to double-check AI outputs because they can be confidently wrong. Using AI in this way saved time but still required me to review and revise the responses.
This week, I explored AI-assisted coding to help me complete my Python assignments more efficiently. I asked the AI to suggest ways to loop through lists and manipulate data, then tested the code to see if it worked as intended. I noticed that while the AI provided correct syntax, sometimes the logic needed slight adjustments to fit my specific problem. I also practiced using the AI to explain tricky concepts, like list slicing and boolean logic, which helped me understand the material faster. Overall, AI acted as a helpful guide, but I still had to actively engage with the code to ensure it was accurate and met the assignment requirements.

This week, I used AI to help summarize and organize information for a class assignment on company research tools. I asked ChatGPT to provide details on platforms like VBIC, Glassdoor, and others, including what kind of information each tool provides. This helped me quickly identify which resources I could use for my project without spending hours manually checking each site.
I used ChatGPT to help me review SQL DML concepts (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) and clarify how autocommit works in MySQL Workbench. The explanation helped me understand that, by default, changes are automatically committed unless autocommit is turned off. The AIâ€™s concise breakdown of how transactions and commits work made it easier for me to remember key differences for the quiz. I also learned that MySQL Workbench can simulate transactions for practice.
This week, I used ChatGPT to help me understand how to define classes and methods in Python.
I worked on a notebook that involved making classes like Book, Loan, and Library. The AI helped me figure out how to use things like @classmethod, @staticmethod, and how to calculate date differences with datetime.
It explained everything in simple terms, which made it way easier to understand how self works in methods.
