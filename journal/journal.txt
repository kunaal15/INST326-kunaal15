This week I used AI to help me draft a discussion post for my class about AI tools and their limitations. I compared responses from two different AI platforms, Gemini and Claude, to see how context affects accuracy. I also used AI to help me draft a reply to a classmate. I learned that AI responses are much better when the AI has context or prior information. I also realized it is important to double-check AI outputs because they can be confidently wrong. Using AI in this way saved time but still required me to review and revise the responses.
This week, I explored AI-assisted coding to help me complete my Python assignments more efficiently. I asked the AI to suggest ways to loop through lists and manipulate data, then tested the code to see if it worked as intended. I noticed that while the AI provided correct syntax, sometimes the logic needed slight adjustments to fit my specific problem. I also practiced using the AI to explain tricky concepts, like list slicing and boolean logic, which helped me understand the material faster. Overall, AI acted as a helpful guide, but I still had to actively engage with the code to ensure it was accurate and met the assignment requirements.
